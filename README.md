# Introduction
This is the third iteration of Zapolemos Lite.  
The first two were written in MicroPython,  
but I finally made the switch to C++  
Currently this is only available for Windows
## Dependencies
[MinGW](https://mingw-w64.org) (for compiling C++)  
[Python](https://www.python.org) 
## Setup
Run build.py to compile the game code  

For a default save path, create a file in data/path.txt
## Community
